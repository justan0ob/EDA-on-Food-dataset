<h2> Where should the csv's be stored ? </h2>
The csv file should be in the same directory as a jupyter notebook
<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Jupyter notebook </li>
  <li>Pandas should be installed</li>
  <li>Plotly library </li>
</ul>

<h2> What's the Project about </h2>
This project aims to do the <b>exploratory data analysis (EDA )</b> on the food dataset.
Main aim is to provide insights into the relationships between food, nutrients, compounds, and health
effects, facilitating informed dietary choices.<br> 
Our task in this project is to delve into the wealth of data, perform an indepth exploratory data analysis (EDA), and
I have deal with different type of bread and try to found out whether the breads are healthy to eat over a longer period of time or not.
uncover meaningful insights that could empower individuals, nutritionists, researchers, and food enthusiasts
alike.This project provides practical applications for improving dietary choices and overall well-being.
There are 6 file on which I have worked 
<ul> 
  <li>Content.csv</li>
  <li>Food.csv</li>
  <li>Nutrient.csv</li>
  <li>Compound.csv</li>
  <li>CompoundsHealthEffect.csv</li>
  <li>HealthEffect.csv</li>
</ul>
Firstly I have merge the dataset for betterment and easiness of the dataset
after that the cleaning of the dataset is done.<br> 
In this project we can enter the name or public id of the food we will receive a detailed breakdown analysis of its nutrient and
compound composition per 100 gm of the food in the graph.<br> 
Also there is functionality that enabled us to explore the top 10 foods most abundant in a particular nutrient or compound by using its
name as well as its public id.<br>
The Nutritional Comparison Tool allowing us to compare the nutritional profiles of two foods side by
side. This feature facilitated informed decision-making, guiding users towards choices aligned with their
health goals.<br>
Among different type of bread what changes can be make in bread to make it more healthy for daily edible food with good content of protein and fiber in it.
